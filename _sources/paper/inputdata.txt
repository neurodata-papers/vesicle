vesicle was tested using the Kasthuri14 dataset, available at:  <http://www.openconnectomeproject.org/#!kasthuri11/c12r2>.

More specifically we used a region known to the community as AC4 for training, and a portion of AC3 for testing.  Utility functions distributed as part of CAJAL facilitate downloading these data regions.
