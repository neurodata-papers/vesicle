Modules
*******

This is a high level mapping of modules to functions.  In LONI, a module calls a single executable/commandline function, and workflows are a series of modules. Modules are documented here to identify what script they call and links are provided back to the documentation of those functions.

In order to retain maximum clarity, we implement modules and functions as a 1-1 mapping. More advanced users may choose to consolidate functionality so that one module accomplishes multiple tasks. These design decisions depend on acceptable complexity, user community, and parallelism needed, and are beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Coming Soon!
