### Overview

This directory contains the scripts/information needed to run the Caffe CNN vesicle detection approach described in [Gray Roncal et. al. 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3724).

Note that this depends upon the Caffe-based Object Classification and Annotation (COCA) package [tbd](http://github.tbd).  In fact, the COCA package is what does all the work; the scripts in this directory just provide guidance showing how to set up the synapse detection problem.
