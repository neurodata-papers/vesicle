Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
********************************

This page will be updated to reflect commonly asked questions to provide a common reference point for questions and answers.  Users may also wish to search for answers on the general `OCP Support mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ocp-support>`_ archives.

New questions should be asked on  `our support pages <ocp-support@googlegroups.com>`_.

**How do I get started?**

Please begin with the configuration page, which should get you up and running quickly, and then proceeding to the tutorial pages.

**What are the limitations of your protocol?**

This initial version of vesicle-rf depends on membrane boundaries completed as a prior step (this will be documented separately).  vesicle-cnn has no prior dependencies.  We have only tested the code with two datasets to date:  kasthuri14 and bock11.  

**What updates are planned?**

We develop new functionality in response to user needs.  We are currently considering additional development for synapse detection in new datasets (e.g., pretrained classifiers), and other large scale runs.  If you have a special request that is not currently supported, please let us know!
